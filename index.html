<!-- Code Challenge #5 | 25 Points -->

<!-- Directions:

Step 1:
Select all of this document, copy and paste it into a new document in sublime text.

Step 2:
Inside of the .container div, insert typography tags h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. Add some content inside of each tag. 

Step 3: 
After each h tag, add a p tag with some content inside of it.

Step 3:
In the style tag, write some CSS for each of the tags you added to create a well-designed typography style tile. Consider things like font-family, font-size, color, letter-spacing, line-height, etc.

Step 4: 
Paste all the code from your sublime document back into github and commit your changes.

BONUS: Implement a web font from font-squirrel correctly for 3 extra points.
